A command-line interface to bulk delete workflow runs of GitHub actions.

---

## Install

_GitHub Workflow Runs Cleaner_ is published as `github-workflow-runs-cleaner` to
the npm registry.

You can install it:

```sh
npm i --global github-workflow-runs-cleaner
```

## Usage

```sh
github-workflow-runs-cleaner

# or

gwrc
```

The CLI will ask you how to connect to your repository, which workflows to
select and which runs to delete.

You need a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and write
access to the repository. And if the repository is not public, the token needs
the `repo` scope.

The CLI also supports GitHub Enterprise.
